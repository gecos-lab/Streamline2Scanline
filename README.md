Spacing statistics analysis algorithms are derived, with refactoring, from those used in [DomStudioFracStat1D](https://github.com/gecos-lab/DomStudioFracStat1D), discussed in the paper [Bistacchi A., Mittempergher S., Martinelli M., Storti F., 2020. On a new robust workflow for the statistical and spatial analysis of fracture data collected with scanlines (or the importance of stationarity), Solid Earth, 11, 2535–2547, 2020](https://doi.org/10.5194/se-11-2535-2020).
